# My Very First Website

Welcome! 

This small and basic website was built to demonstrate and practice the skills I have learnt throughout the first few modules of the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)'s Fullstack Web Development Course. 

Please take a look at the website [here!](https://shellied.github.io/my-full-template/)

## Description

This site was built as a walkthrough project to become familiar with Gitpod and Github, whilst also practising the skills I had already learned through the HTML and CSS Essentials modules on the course.  Each page of the website shows a clickable logo that will link to a website where you can find out more about each technology used in Web Development and which technologies will be used for each section of the course. 

### Features

<ul>Navigation Bar
<li>Featured on each page, the navigation bar includes links to Stream One, Stream Two and Stream Three.</li>
<li>CSS stying is used so you can easily see which part of the navigation menu you are hovering over</li>
<li>Allows the user to navigate easily between all three pages</li>
</ul>

<ul>Clickable Logos
<li>Clicking on a logo will open the link in a new tab</li>
<li>This feature allows the user to switch between the original website and the linked pages rather than using the back button.  The user can have many pages open at the same time</li>
</ul>

### Technology

HTML and CSS were used to create the content and styling of the website.  The code itself was written in Gitpod and is now currently hostes via Github pages.
